IMG-ProPortal: A data discovery environment for <em>Prochlorococcus</em> related -omics data
	</h1>

	<p>In support of developing a data discovery environment that will allow researchers from different disciplines to explore and manipulate -omics data related to the most abundant marine photosynthetic organism, <em>Prochlorococcus</em>.</p>
	<p>
		<em>Prochlorococcus</em> is the most abundant photosynthetic microbial cell on the planet and as such contributes significantly to the global carbon cycle and oxygenation of the atmosphere. Thus, understanding <em>Prochlorococcus</em> as well as its sister group, <em>Synechococcus</em>, and the phage that infect them at a genomic level has important implications for our understanding of global ecological mechanisms. <em>Prochlorococcus </em>has been proposed as a model system for studying not only ecology and oceanography, but also other fields of biology including evolutionary biology, systems biology, and synthetic biology for several reasons: (1) it has a very small genome (roughly 2000 genes); (2) it relies only on inorganic compounds for growth; and (3) it lives in an aquatic environment where environmental selection pressures such as light, temperature and nutrient concentrations can be easily measured.&nbsp; To aid in the mission of elevating <em>Prochlorococcus</em> to model system status, we are developing within the Joint Genome Institute’s Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) system a <em>Prochlorococcus</em> "portal" to house all relevant, public ‘omics datasets in a space that allows researchers to easily explore and analyze this data in an ecological context. Our hope is that by providing powerful analysis tools, centralizing all <em>Prochlorococcus</em> ‘omics data, and linking it to detailed measurements of its natural habitat as well as population and physiological data, we can facilitate novel discoveries that will further our understanding of phototrophic energy conversion as well as microbiology, ecology and evolution in ocean ecosystems.

		Many decades of research on<em> Prochlorococcus </em>and its sister microbe<em> Synechococcus </em>have produced an abundance of data, including dozens of whole genome sequences, metagenomes, transcriptomes and metatranscriptomes, as well as time-series population measurement data. It has also produced analyses of growth rates as a function of environmental variables and physiological responses to various environmental stressors. While this large body of data contains unprecedented information it also creates challenges for analyzing it in ways that take full advantage of the scope of the data sets. The JGI’s IMG system has championed this challenge for over a decade, and has made significant advancements toward large-scale data analysis of microbial data sets. Harnessing these advancements, IMG/ProPortal will take advantage of the following strengths: (1) an automated pipeline for adding new data sets over time; (2) a large suite of powerful genomics analysis pipelines including gene annotation, functional analyses, phylogenetic tree building and comparative analysis; and (3) a well-established wealth of genomic data on microbes from many other diverse environments. Building on these strengths, new analysis tools will be built that will allow scientists to study the genetics of <em>Prochlorococcus</em> within its ecological context. By integrating ecological measurements of the marine environment with the large body of <em>Prochlorococcus </em>genomic data, IMG/ProPortal will provide a way for scientists to study the complex ecological and evolutionary interplay between <em>Prochlorococcus</em> and its natural environment.
